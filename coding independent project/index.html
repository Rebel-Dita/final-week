        <h3>Single Mums</h3>
        <p>It is not a surprise these days to become a single parent. No matter whatâ€™s the reason, youâ€™re not on your own and we are here to chat about ever changing life, people, struggles, depression, joys, pride, and love.</p>

<h3> About me</h3>
        <p>My name is Dita. I am quite spontaneous, adventurous, possibly smart in some ways.
I like to be the best myself possible but being a full-time student, full time mum, daughter, friend, partner (as I am in the new relationship) is a lot to take on after 9-year relationship with the father of my children.

<h3> Furthermore</h3>
I was supposed to take antidepressants 6 week ago, but I can barely find the strength or the time to take a good care of myself.
Donâ€™t worry darling. I knew before you visited my site that your struggles somehow match mine. Betrayal, abuse, disappointment, rudeness is just few on my daily list waiting to be resolved once and for all. Will it ever happen I wonder?
I would love to know more about your journey. Please feel free to leave your story. Coming together might help us to embrace the days to follow. We could use our experiences to help other mums to get back on their feet, feel motivated again.
A little whinge is a treat for our mental health ðŸ˜Š
